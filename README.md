# Git Practice Project
This is a basic project for practicing working with git. Git is the most commonly used version control system/software, which in simple terms, allows you managed and track changes and history of a project. You can do everything from seeing who made a change and when. You can go back to previous verion of your project if you messed up. You can make multiple copies of your project and work on features separately and merge all of your work together. Git is a very powerful tool and is a must-know tool to have in your skill set.
